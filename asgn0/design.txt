1 Goal
The goal of this program is to print the content of the file provided in standard input (stdin). The
program should print the content of the file standard output.

2 Assumptions
we can only use the open(), close(), read(), perror() and write() system calls

3 Design
The general approach:
   	case1: when there are files, repeatedly read a file from the arguement list, and print the content of the file by calling
   	a function. In the function, first we need to open the file, then read the content of the file and put the data in the buffer, and
	then write the data of the buffer to stdout, if the file doesn't exist, print error message.

        case2: If no files are specified on the command line, mycat will copy standard input to standard output until
        eof is sent as the first character of a line. If eof is sent as the last character of the line, the program print the current line and 
        read the next character, if the next character is eof end the program else keep looping.

4 Pseudocode
main
 if size of argv > 1
   loop from 1 to size of argv
      printfile(argv[i])
 else
    Declare buffer of size 1
    while(true)
       eof=READ(stdin, buffer,  size 1)
       if(eof==true and buffer[0]==newline)
          break
       if(buffer[0]!=newline and eof==true)
          if(READ(stdin, buffer,  size 1)!=eof)
             WRITE(stdout, buffer, 1)
             continue
           else
             break
       WRITE(stdout, buffer, 1)
    end while
end main

procedure printfile(file)
      file descriptor<-open(file, O_RDONLY, 0)
      if (file descriptor return true)
          Declare buffer of size 1
          while(READ(file descriptor, buffer,  1)!=EOF)
               WRITE(stdout, buffer, 1)
          close(file descriptor)
       else
         output("file doesn't exist") to stderror
end procedure
